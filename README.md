# Salutations

> "SOME PIG" ... "TERRIFIC" ... "RADIANT" ... "HUMBLE"

Salutations is an HTML+CSS starter theme made with Jinja / Twig templating syntax.  You can use it to quickly and easily develop website themes.

### Why use this theme?
* Organized and over-ridable:  Each element is a logical separated [Jinja block](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#block), called a "chunk", which you can easily change in your own themes.
* Composable layouts:  Easily add, change, and move around chunks to build any layout you want using flexible grids.
* Collaborative:  Start with a common codebase so you can share your layouts, queries, and color schemes with other themers.

### Included Libraries
* [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/): a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
* [PureCSS Grids](http://purecss.io/grids/): easy to work with, and very powerful.

### Notes
* Currently targeted for latest [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican) codebase.
* Needs this patch for inheritance functionality: [Inherit from arbitrary theme #1092](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/1092).

# Pelican Base Theme

Base is a starter theme for [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican).  (Currently, it depends on a patch to [Inherit from arbitrary theme #1092](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican/issues/1092).)

### Uses
* Organize and override:  Each page element is logically separated in a [Jinja block](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/#block), called a "widget".
* Compose your templates:  Layouts are easy to build using grids and are easy to fill with reusable widget code.
* Collaborate with others:  Begin with the common code as other Pelican themers and create your own theme.

### Included Libraries
* [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) is a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
* [PureCSS Grids](http://purecss.io/grids/) are easy to work with, and very powerful.

### Thank you
* Pelican maintainers and contributors for an amazing framework.
* [Lightweight Theme](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/lightweight) for providing a great starting point for this project.
* The [Drupal Project](https://drupal.org) and themes like [Basic Theme](https://drupal.org/project/basic) for rapidly prototyping great web technology.

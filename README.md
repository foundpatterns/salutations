# Pelican Base Theme

Base is a starter theme for [Pelican](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican).

* Organize your logic.  Each page element lives in a separate file, in the "widgets" directory.
* Compose your templates.  Layouts are easy to make using grids and easy to fill from swappable code.
* Don't duplicate efforts.  Begin with the same code as other Pelican themers.
* Help plugin developers help you.  Widgets are a big help.

### Features
* [PureCSS](http://purecss.io) from [YUI](http://yui.yahooapis.com) provides js-free responsiveness
* [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) provides an efficient, dynamic, and expressive way to generate CSS.

### Help wanted
* Templating - only ```base.html```, ```index.html```, and ```article.html``` have been wigetized
* Styling - this would be nice
* Reviewing - submit an issue with your thoughts after reading the code
